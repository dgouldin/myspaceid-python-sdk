The samples provided in this directory are based on Google App Engine(GAE) and require the GAE SDK to run. 

Please make sure to install the  Google App Engine SDK first from here (http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html) 
before proceeding to run the sample applications.

After you have verified that the GAE environment is properly setup, you can run the samples locally in your GAE environment.
To run the samples, simply copy the following directories to corresponding application path and then run your local GAE 
dev_appserver script:

	src\myspace
	src\oauthlib
	src\openid
	src\simplejson
	
For example, to run the openid-combined-consumer application please copy the directories above to the openid-combined-consumer 
directory and then run your dev_appserver script.
